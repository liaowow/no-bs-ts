### How do you look up hints for type specification?
#### Highlight the variable or function name, hit `command K` + `command I`. 

### What is a union type?
#### It allows a variable to hold values of multiple types. This is useful when you want a variable to accept more than one type of value. You define a union type by using the pipe (|) symbol between the types.

### What is function overloading?
#### It's a feature in TypeScript that allows multiple function signatures for a single function implementation, enabling the function to handle different types and numbers of arguments.
